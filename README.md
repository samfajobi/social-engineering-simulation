# Phishing Awareness & Social Engineering Simulation

This project demonstrates how attackers use fake login pages and social engineering to harvest credentials, and how users can be trained to recognize and avoid these attacks.

This lab was conducted in a **controlled and ethical environment** for cybersecurity awareness and educational purposes only.

## Objective
- Simulate a real-world phishing scenario
- Observe how users interact with phishing links
- Demonstrate how easily credentials can be exposed
- Train users to detect phishing attempts

## What was built
- A TikTok-style login page clone using HTML and CSS
- A backend that records form submissions (for demonstration only)
- Social-engineering messages to simulate attacker behavior
- Awareness training for participants
